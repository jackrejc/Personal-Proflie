   <h3>Interest in IT</h3>
   </p>
  <div>
    
  <p>My interest in IT started in year 8, high school at an Information Technology course. In this course I was making websites, learning about computer software and hardware and creating databases to improve a variety of components. My friend Lane was the person that make me do the course in the first place, I am glad he did.
I choose to come to RMIT because of the benefits this university provided over others at the time. Being 100% online make it easier for me personal as I live in the NSW state so travel would be challenging, especially now.
I expect to learn a variety of things such as, HTML and CSS, implications of technology and the benefits, what potential jobs I could get into and the challenges they might face in a business environment.

    <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
    <p>I have looked into this particular job for a long time to come, to have this particular skill set and work in a business environment would be my dream. To get into this job I would need experience in .NET or Java, have experience in creating databases and have essential leadership skills to create a better working environment.
    The only experience I would currently have is working with databases, and a small amount of java learnt. Otherwise I am looking to improve my skills through further education.
  My plan to obtain these skills is through countless courses through universities and a possible internship that will grant me the experience I need to develop these traits. 
From these results that I can gather that I have a leadership ability with some confidence issues regarding my knowledge of certain topics, I am a hands-on leaner with more leaned back approach to learning and my personal creativity isnâ€™t quite as in depth and does need more development.
      I would rely on others to provide ideas with some input, while I collaborate them and delegate appropriately into a structured form. 
      Me relying on others creativity would mean brighter minded individuals and the approval of a smaller team to collaborate and more effectively produce project ideas.
