   <h3>Interest in IT</h3>

  <p style="background-colour #f3f3f3">My interest in IT started in year 8, high school at an Information Technology course. In this course I was making websites, learning about computer software and hardware and creating databases to improve a variety of components. My friend Lane was the person that make me do the course in the first place, I am glad he did.
I choose to come to RMIT because of the benefits this university provided over others at the time. Being 100% online make it easier for me personal as I live in the NSW state so travel would be challenging, especially now.
I expect to learn a variety of things such as, HTML and CSS, implications of technology and the benefits, what potential jobs I could get into and the challenges they might face in a business environment.

    <h3>Ideal Job</h3>
    <p style="background-colour #f3f3f3">I have looked into this particular job for a long time to come, to have this particular skill set and work in a business environment would be my dream. To get into this job I would need experience in .NET or Java, have experience in creating databases and have essential leadership skills to create a better working environment.
    The only experience I would currently have is working with databases, and a small amount of java learnt. Otherwise I am looking to improve my skills through further education.
  My plan to obtain these skills is through countless courses through universities and a possible internship that will grant me the experience I need to develop these traits. 
From these results that I can gather that I have a leadership ability with some confidence issues regarding my knowledge of certain topics, I am a hands-on leaner with more leaned back approach to learning and my personal creativity isn’t quite as in depth and does need more development.
      I would rely on others to provide ideas with some input, while I collaborate them and delegate appropriately into a structured form. 
      Me relying on others creativity would mean brighter minded individuals and the approval of a smaller team to collaborate and more effectively produce project ideas.

  <h3>Project Idea</h3>
  <p style="background-colour #f3f3f3">For my project idea, and with the world in shambles due to the COVID-19 I propose small portable device that is suited for a smartphone that is able to extract a sample, process it and give you a result within the hour. Of course, a software would have to be developed as well. An app for both android and apple would be developed along with this device. The end result of the app would be able to track the virus, using data and statistics from reliable sources such as CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention) and WHO (World Health Organisation). Also, to provide information of symptoms, what to do if found infected, if your concerned of the health and safety of others, information about the disease itself and preventable methods that can be used.
Because of the ever-growing finical disruption that this virus is causing and the vast interest that most people have with this virus, monetisation strategies could be used to gain financial stability. Using Ads and other advertisement methods could interest businesses into advertising their business through our app. Google ads could be used as well. 
This device if successful would be a revolutionary change into the spread and changing dynamic in the virus. With technologies as live maps to show virus spread the “Hotspots”, essential businesses that are still currently open, and a portable device that is able to accurately determine the infection of people would change the amount of fear that this virus spreads. This device might not only be used to determine COVID-19 spread rates, it could as show data on various other diseases and illnesses and provide even further testing on those diseases. Although to achieve this goal of a consistent testing and data display, it would need a very large investment and constant funding to grow and sustain a financial stability. This could prove challenging, although if enough traction is gained funding would be possible from larger health organisations and government officials. This app could change countless variables and could change the way we look at the COVID-19 altogether, with possible branches into other diseases.
Yes, there are apps that have touched on this idea some of them including; tracetogther and the selfie app. The “tracetogether” works by exchanging Bluetooth signals between phones that come within close proximity of each other. Anyone that reports a case of COVID-19 and has been within close proximity within another phone will force upon the user to go into an incubation period of 7 days. This has helped relief efforts from WHO, who are praising the developed of this app. The “Selfie app” has freed up manpower and resources when it comes to the mandatory 14-day quarantine. The government gave residents a choice, either to download this app or receive unexpected visits from the police or download this app. This app uses facial recognition allowing quarantined user to check-in with authorities to confirm they are indeed staying at home as required. These apps plus my app are very similar in nature. To provide an easier UI and system for people that are affected and allowing more resources for governmental use.
In conclusion, if this app was to progress and develop, a massive change in many variables of the spread and quarantine of this virus would occur. Not only providing information to people but also providing even further accurate results as well as changing the dynamic and severity of the virus in the long term. There is not much we can do now until a vaccine is released but we develop IT related material to slow the spread. 
The software to be used to make it’s the most readily accessible would be an app on android and apple phones. According to pewresearch.org. over 77% of the total population of earth have smartphones so it’s the easiest accessible option 
The skills required for this project would not only be IT related, but a business insight into various finical options. To develop this app, I would need to be able to have extensive knowledge into a code such as java or python and market tools. For the external device I would need connections with outside manufactures and engineers.
This project could be successful, although many implications could occur the main factor being funding, a lot of funding would be need to grant the success of this project. Again to overcome this problem connections would need to be developed early if not the development of this app with be longer with further and further implications. In conclusion this app and hardware is possible and could change many factors of the virus just needs extensive funding.
