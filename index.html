   <h3>Interest in IT</h3>

  <p>My interest in IT started in year 8, high school at an Information Technology course. In this course I was making websites, learning about computer software and hardware and creating databases to improve a variety of components. My friend Lane was the person that make me do the course in the first place, I am glad he did.
I choose to come to RMIT because of the benefits this university provided over others at the time. Being 100% online make it easier for me personal as I live in the NSW state so travel would be challenging, especially now.
I expect to learn a variety of things such as, HTML and CSS, implications of technology and the benefits, what potential jobs I could get into and the challenges they might face in a business environment.
